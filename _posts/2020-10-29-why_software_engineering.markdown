CLI project - Edm festivals  is not the first program that I have ever written. I had learned some programming skills with Pascal language back in middle school but after that the high school which I transferred to did not focus on teaching computer science. That was the reason why my future career was guided toward something related to health care. I have a bachelor degree in biochemistry as a cornerstone for me to pursue higher education and get a professional occupation in the healthcare system such as a medical doctor, a pharmacist, or a veterinarian. 
I graduated in 2018 and worked for 2 biotech companies ( I stayed one year for each). After 2 years I acknowledged that a laboratory position is totally not for me. I was not happy or showed that I was interested enough in my work every single day even though I had to act the opposite in front of my boss, of course. Until May this year, the thought of changing company ignited again but I was afraid that the problem might not come from the companies but rather from myself. Besides that covid hit the U.S so hard so the option of changing companies was not a good idea at this time. Deep down I didn't really want to go through the hectic process of applying and interviewing again so I made a remarkable decision that I would go back to school and have another degree in software engineering. Why software engineering? Well, this is my blog not the personal statement for the school so I am not gonna lie. It’s the money. Imagine my friend and I both have our b.s degrees. He has one in computer science and mine is biochemistry. He is earning $40/hr and I’m earning $22/hr. I even did better in school than him. How fair is that? I’m not jealous with him, happy for him instead. But with my ability, I believe I deserve more than that. Therefore here I am, attending Flatiron school with a dream to become a software engineer in a near future. See you in the next blog.
