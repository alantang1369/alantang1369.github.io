It has been three months since I finished my first project - cli. I have not been studying efficiently, I admitted . I’m supposed to study full time 8 - 10 hours a day but it’s so disappointing that I have spent so much time procrastinating. The sinatra project is indeed a bit harder compared to the first one. There were so many things to learn before I could start to work on the project.

Recently, besides programming I have just built a hobby of botany. I’m enjoying propagating roses and hibiscuses from cuttings. I have transformed my tiny front yard of my place into a mini greenhouse where I’m trying to control temperature and humidity. My rose cuttings after 40 days are showing significant living signs. New green leaves pop up on all stems. After so many failures, I’m trying to control every factor to be successful this time.  I think I’m ready to have some new roses for my garden. 

I have a pot of acapulco golden hibiscus. It’s extremely beautiful with yellow, red, pink and white blooms. The 8” inches flowers are very eye-catching. Unfortunately due to lack of experience with hibiscus I let them have root rot and 4 out 5 plants in the pot have died. I was heartbroken. I went on the internet to do research on how to rescue a plant with root rot but there is none. This is a kind of disease we had better prevent than cure. The more I do research, the more fascinated I feel toward hibiscus plants, especially the tropical type. They are just amazing with colorful and gigantic flowers. I’m so obsessed that I decided to build this app with the hibiscus theme.  It is a simple app with signup, sign in, signout  features. When you get into the app you will be able to build your garden by adding new hibiscus plants as well as visit the other user’s garden. You can also edit and delete your plants but not the others.  After this module, I know the basis of sql, active record, object relational mapping and sinatra. The thing I need to improve is css skills. I feel like I have not known enough to build a pretty website. I hope I will learn more about it in the upcoming modules.
